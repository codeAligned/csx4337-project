Student Name: Soumyendu Sarkar Student ID: X123160 Course: COMPSCI X433.7 Machine Learning With TensorFlow Project Proposal: Implement Transfer Learning to retrain an ImageNet dataset trained convolutional neural network model to classify the different flower species from images of flowers. This method will reuse the lower convolution layers of the image classifier for their feature extraction capabilities and train a fully connected new classification layer on top to detect different species of flowers. In this project the various hyper parameters like learning rate, batch size, and regularization will be tuned to improve model training. This project will also include visualization of the training with Tensorboard. Data Source : http://download.tensorflow.org/example_images/flower_photos.tgz This project has been chosen to demonstrate the power of transfer learning and to show how smaller image datasets can be effectively used by convolutional neural network with limited computation to create a highly accurate image classifier.
